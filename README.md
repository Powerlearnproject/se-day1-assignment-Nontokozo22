#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software applications.
It is important because it ensures that the sofware is logical to the user, provides security to sensitive information, the software is efficient and meet the needs of a growing business.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The shift to agile methodologies from the inflexible and prone to failure waterfall model.

Software maintainance wheee a software that is already in use is changed by modifying existing components and adding new components.

Dealing with complexity of the system components, control structures, data structures and object, method and  data size.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - considerng the demands, skills and expertise needed for the client.
2. Analysis - conduct preliminary analysis of the business to discover the goals and issues for the client.
3. Design - creating the oftware architecture, components and interfaces.
4. Implementation - writting the code for the software using the design outline and conduct code reviews to ensure quality and adherence to the coding standards.
5. Testing and intergration - testing provides the detailed map of breakdows that needs to be fixed and the effectiveness of the software.
6. Maintenance - provide ongoing support and maintenance of the software, implement new feaures or enhancements and perfomr regular backups and software updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process with distinct phase that must be completed one at a time, while Agile use iterative cycles with continous feedback, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements throughout the project life.

Waterfall methodology will be well suited in a manufacturing process as productions lines require a sequential approach.

Agile methodology is wel suited for software development where requirements can change rapidly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer designs, develops,tests and maintains software applcation and also work with cross-functional teams to ensure that the software requirements are met.

Quality Assurance Engineer develop and executes software tests to ensure quality and reliability of the software. They work with developers to resolve defects and improve software quality.

Project manager develops project plans, timelines and budgets. They track the project progress, identified isuues and take corrective action.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Time management; Long hours and tight deadlines.

- Use time management techniques like the promodoo technique.

- Balancing between quality and being fast paced.
         

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of writting instructions to get the best results from generative AI models. The instructions must provide context and plain instructions to help the AI understand what it needs to do.

It is important to interact with AI models as it feeds it information which will then make it easier for the user to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Provide a tax allowance law that deals with the purchasing of a building.

Improved prompt: What is the tax alowance law regarding the purchasing of a commercial building that will be rented out to a person or business who will use it as an office space when we are in the business of leasing buildings?
